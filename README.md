# Screen-Shot-and-Email
This Python script periodically takes screenshots of your computer screen, saves them as PNG files, and then emails them in batches to a specified email address. Once a batch of screenshots is successfully sent, the script cleans up by deleting the local image files.  This can be used for monitoring activity on a computer.
